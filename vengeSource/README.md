so that its easier to spot these players on the leaderboard or maybe even in-game

+ Fix report button, it does different thing (in game reports are different)


## Testing
+ Have a variable for already joined (on finish, and on start, because of reset)
+ Second game shouldn't focus to the pause camera after joining, only for first game
+ Make continue join, then make it continue

+ Have a proper HTML loading screen

+ It showed wrong name on result screen, it showed sierra then put me into sandstorm


+ Set next random map from server
- Put timer beside continue (for the AFK)


+ Add settings
+ Don't put users into a game (they should activate theirselves with a signal)


## REST

- Clear hackers_fetcher database

+ When we switch a new game, enable pause menu but also disable gameplay elements

## Final touches
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zG8xm4fsF_E&t=205s&ab_channel=Enderious
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jn7VV_MWxQA&ab_channel=AvyavGaming
- Test game overall

## Later
- Add spray shader

- When we switch to the home page, it should clear the hash for reload purposes

## Result screen
+ Transition for reward ads
+ Add friend
+ Add report, add friend and commend button functionalities
+ Add chat menu
+ Add banner to the bottom-left
+ Add timer bar
+ Add animation for the action-lines
+ Show how much coin I earned (trigger it on half, so they can wait until that point)

## TODO
- Replace thumbnails, fix matchmaking
- Loadout for in-game screen, so we can show more reward ads

+ Fix spray shader, people want them (add material ready)
+ Define categories for the maps
+ Add search
- Show thumbnail area



- Give them different crosshairs

- Fix map editor interface
- Pirate skin has issues
- Show maps on profiles, who created them

- For suicede, we should different icon on announcement
- Bulk sell fix

- Fix weapon equipment
- Fix thumbnail for the TAB menu
- Add a way to see what weapon the player who killed you is using. Either by displaying the thumbnail/ name/rarity and any combination of those on the death screen.

- Language improvements everywhere
- from the social hub we should be able to assort our items in our inventory by rarity, just like you can on the market

- notification system, where we can send notification to users
- Knowing the exact date someone made an account would be great. Instead of "Joined 1 year ago", I propose it should say for example: "Joined 3/1/20" so people can know the exact date they joined. A bit like an anniversary.

- Clan search to the social hub
- able to check peoples inventory would be very helpful, even if trading doesnt get added soon, this still would be op

- This game seems like empty, you wanna find another match now?
- Adding on to the mic suggestion; I understand why there shouldn't be a mic feature, but i think it'd be entertaining and fun, it would also help to communicate in Mistle. Make it where the feature is already off and if someone playing wants it to be on, they can go into settings and turn it on. Guests/No account users wont be able to access this feature or hear others that have it on without an account.
- Show the % chances of unboxing specific rarities

- Add categories for the custom maps
- Custom map "undefined" custom mode problem, "SniperBase"
- Fix item change on shop inventory, where it doesn't set default skins properly

- Optimize shop page's font-sizes, layout little bit more for Poki's iframe, since most of them are guest users who plays on poki
- Home page banners should be even smarter, right now we redirect them to the heroes, now what we can do :
Heroes, on second game, weapons, on third game skins...
- When user selects the hero, there is only sound, improve that layout little bit more, so they can understand what they selected

- you are missing out VGs (you are potentially losing %20 VG)

Clans and clan shop:

Only clan leaders and sub-owners can shop for the clan.
Clan shopping is done with exchange of clan VG.
Some clan features are only certain clan titles.

Clan items:
Items that clan has and all members can wear. They could have a placeholder replacements to be changed, as default charm was cube. Replacements can be bought from Clan Shop.

Clan Charm, clan spray, clan armband: Default clan items to show off that they are a member of a clan. This can be modelled with a model making contest that offers award.


Items can be bought from clan shop:
Clan logo on names: 💥[YODO] ZoNF
Custom clan role titles. (Default: Founder, Co-founder, Member)
Custom clan charms. (Default: Venge Clan Charm.)
Custom clan armbands (Default: Venge Clan Armband.)
Custom clan texture spray (Default: Venge Clan Spray.)
Custom clan weapon skins (Has no default)

6. Store discounts
7. Next season closed beta access
8. Badges shown on profile
9. Ability to join grand tournament
10. 50 fireworks can be spent in matches

Battle pass:
A level system consists presents at each rate.
For example, a typical battle pass should look like this:
Level 1 - Specific common doodah
Level 2 - Specific common weapon skin
Level 3 - Sparking sprites explosion effect (just for the season)
Level 4 - Specific common dance
Level 5 - Specific common lootbox
Level 6 - Specific rare doodah

-Quest that requires you to say "GG" or "WP" at the end of a match does not function, neither of the messages register as progression.
-Quest that requires you to go 35 matches without dying resets progress back to 0 upon death. (Not sure if this is by design)
-Certain charms are not visible when equipped.
+Certain sprays are shown as default "GG" sprays when equiped.
-Corpses can sometimes retain collision above them until the person respawns.
-Players can sometimes continue to occupy a spot in a lobby after they have left.
-Being killed while attempting to buy results in current tier progression being reset back to 0. (Not sure if this is by design)
-Leaving a match early does not save any score made during the match. (Not sure if this is by design)
-Leaving a match early does not save any quest progression made during the match. (Not sure if this is by design)
-Using Shin's Dash at point blank of another player can sometimes cause it to deal no damage.
-Miscellaneous locations in maps where a player can fall under the map.
-Lobbies save the player's statuses from the previous match, for example, playing on Mistle the previous match will result in red/blue teams still being shown even after loading into a different map.

They get super frustrated when they get switched onto the other team when they are doing well

- punishment for leaving games
- release buy coin thing after 2 weeks after shop release
- only CC roles should get drop rights
- For your crates, weapon skins should be the cheapest in my opinion, then accessory, then character skins, then make dance's the most rare to get, then the rarity of each thing within them. Can make a quite expensive Crate, like 20k VG for the "best" rarity items and have a pool of those within it. Instant Gold Dump for all the people who stashed up a lot while keeping a high incentive for people to grind to.

## Character ideas
Imba:

A big and strong character seems powerful but has a big flaw beneath. He is a giant with 3x more health point pool, 2x taller and bigger than other characters. He is 1.5x more vulnurable to spells.

Has only melee abilities;
e - rushes forward, hits anything in his path ant pushes them to opposite way of impact,
f - swings his axe left to right and hit anything it touches (area of effect)
mouse1 - hits regular melee
mouse2 - hits strong melee

## Notes
- scam card
Battle royale - last man standing:
9 floor platform that slowly infested by energy field which causes muscle shock. If you fall behind shock stuns will make you impossible to exit from within field.

The battle will move towerds middle parts of the platform so players eventually going to be needed to move 5th floor.

Going upstairs will be possible with stairs on the north & jumping pods on east, south and west.

Cards system could be adapted.

Player kill gives extra grenade.

There would be traps set on the floor, walls, gates, windows.

- show score on profile page
- test public matches
+ show KDR for daily leaderboard
- add game to twitch
- jungle map
- open server if it doesn't have enough players after reload
- Create a card that decrease affects of cards.
- Nerf Tec-9 with tolga's prompt
- Limit tier levels to 3, update numbers if needed.
+ Check request reward message, it triggered twice
- Implement AFK functionality.
- Change sparky spells name to "sparking sprites"

+ skip ads doesn't work, because it locks mouse?
+ when I kill people, it shows labels on them even tho they went to buy card scene, on hide, hide also labels

- join even with 2 players, and keep server open
- write a long description
- make sure new server invite deploy and works (rematchmaking)
- when it's fully empty, quit from session
- dom:resize
- when I refresh the page, it doesn't allow me to join same private game, why?

- shooting grenades causes issue?
- ability : confusing clones (laugh sounds by player)

+ make sure it doesn't show pause menu when it's finished

- Consecutive gameplayStart trigger issues fixed.
- On reward ads it mutes game now, fixed.
- I believe displaying ads on weapon selection menu can cause problem since PokiSDK doesn't have banner refresh functionality.
- Mobile version of game is not ready. It's still under development. I'll contact with Poki again once we have mobile version fully released.
- Pause menu added for in-game. (ESC or mouse unlock)
- Player disconnect issues fixed, it doesn't show up at the center of map anymore.
- FPS display removed.
- Now, you can cancel reload animations.
- Weapon selection popup issues fixed. (CSS Responsive)
- Pressing 1, 2, 3 respawn issue fixed.
- Mouse sensivity setting added to main menu.
- Cards comes up randomly, since we don't only few cards for tier 2 it might show duplicated cards.
- Damages buffed for Scar and Tec-9, clip size changed for Scar.
- For chat profanity filter added.
- Gangnam style removed from list, I'll hire artist to make that animation later. For now I set default another dance in the system.
- Space key is no prevent page scrolls.
- Grenade explosion problem fixed.
- Show disconnected error on game play, if player disconnects.
- Map bounderies patched.

- out of map issues fixed
- shooting gas caninzers cause problem, check that?

- make sure it doesn't give you point after game finish
- make sure it sends you to home page when everyone left
- set selected weapon in game and send data over network when player join

- close button canceled whole matchmaking
- enable cancel button at some point for matchmaking
- "One other bug to mention I noticed:  when you receive the venge.io invite URL, it brings you into a game right away. BUT if you're at the main menu, and select a weapon load out - it will remain on the screen while you're joining the session, and you can't close it off or get rid of it.
If you try to click on one of the weapons to select it, for example, it just fires your gun in-game. So, the load out screen covers your view and you can't get rid of it without refreshing the page."
- check everything that can cause error on load

- waiting for start yerine direkt join olak

+ gameplayStart event trigger issues fixed.
+ gameplayStart and gameplayStop logic has been update for dying and respawning.
+ commercialBreak works on find match button.
+ Reward button added, it trigger Poki Reward ads.

+ change sparky spell's duration
+ change melee's distance, it's not very difficiult
? [WEIRD] make difficult tests to break map (it's a really big problem), maybe check some events on players

## Why?
- Well, in browser everything is easy. And we have only limited amount of games on browser. Venge is will be one of them in future.
- With Venge, I'm aiming to get users who wants to play with friends.
- That's said, we'll have systems where you could invite your friends with link easily.
- Game should be designed in a way, so you want to play it tomorrow too!
- You should starve it to play it, because of smooth gameplay.
- You should want to grind for items without focusing your attention to grinding.
- You should be rewarded every action you made in game.
- You shouldn't be punished by bugs or game errors, instead, social aspects of game should makes you feel bad.
- Death should be terrifying but also gives you the hope, that you can actually do better.
+ We are going to provide that feeling with giving you some info and opportunity to win. We can give rocket launcher when you die, so you could get revenge. And even in that case you lose, that's your problem.
- Focus to winning animations, losing animations, these elements makes users feels more intense.

## Gamification
Killers: Players driven by their passion for competition want to beat other players. They expect to take it to the competition with a big stick. They enjoy winning in peer-to-peer competition. They like ranking, recognition, and well published leaderboards.

Achievers: These players like proofs of success: points, possessions, or prizes. They want rewards and prestige with or without advancement in gameplay.

Explorers: Some players just like the thrill of discovery. They like to dig down and find something new or unknown. Secret pathways and rare finds excite them.

Socializers: For others, the social interaction counts more than the game strategy. Relationships are their reward.
